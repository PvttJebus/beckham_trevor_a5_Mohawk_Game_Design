# Lunar Lander 2: Land Lunarer

Welcome to Lunar Lander 2! The goal of the game is to get as high a score as possible by safely landing the lunar lander on the moon! While it IS technically rocket science, it's not too hard, just keep the following in mind upon your decent

While we hope you remember how to fly the lander, here is a brief refresher
- W = Thrust (up)
- A = Rotate Left
- D = Rotate Right
- R = Emergency System Reset (reset lander)

### *Velocity is key*

if you hit the ground too fast, the lander will be destroyed and the mission scrubbed. The higher the multiplier, the softer the ground, this means the lander will have to land slower than normal to make it safe. Our scientists suggest using the following velocity estimates:
  
#### Safe Landing Velocity = SLV
- Normal ground (no multiply): SLV = 3
- x2 Multiplier = SLV 2.5
- x3 Multiplier = SLV 2
- X5 Multiplier = SLV 1.5
- X10 Multiplier = SLV 1

### Additional considerations
- You have a limited fuel supply, using too much on one landing may leave you without enough for your next
- The moon is small, so if you find yourself drifting off course, it may be better to loop around. But avoid going to far from the ground, if you escape the moons gravity, you'll be lost to the stars.
